## Driving to East Ridge

For those driving trailers, be advised we strongly urge you to use the **BAILEY ROAD** entrance to the school.  We are planning pull-through parking which is MUCH easier to access from the Bailey Road entrance.  Additionally, East Ridge is surrounded by roundabouts, entering via Bailey Road bypasses most of the roundabouts.

## Trailer Load-In/Parking

Dedicated pull-through trailer parking will be available on the day of the event.

Load in access is via doors at the gym floor level indicated on the map below.  Load in from the parking spaces as to not block traffic.  East Ridge recently refinished the gym floors.  Please help us keep the floors looking “new”; during load in please be sure to stay on the mats so as to not scratch the floor.

Preferred Human access is via the doors labeled “ACTIVITY ENTRANCE”, but the load-in doors will also be open.

During load in please be sure to stay on the mats as to not scratch the floors. Please reference the parking map below for load and parking information.

## Things to Remember

The shop will be open on an as needed basis (not the whole time).

We will have a carpeted driving practice field area – the size is TBD, as is the availability of field elements. Don’t assume we’ll have an autonomous-ready-setup, but you will be able to drive your bots there.

There will be inexpensive concessions – please take advantage of these so we can invest in making this event even better next year.

## Menu Highlights:

2022 EMCC concessions will include pop and candy and other stuff.

Although cash is welcome, we will have credit card swipe to improve checkout time.

Lunch will be available from at least two food trucks. They set their own prices and EMCC does not profit from their presence.

## Pit Stuff

Pits will be the usual 10×10′ size – you are welcome to be as elaborate or as minimalist as you choose but remember there is no power in the pits.

There will be power to charge batteries, but no power drops in pits.

No pit tables provided – so please bring your own table if needed.

As these events are used for training purposes – to bring new volunteers up to speed for next years competition season, we encourage you to ask for robot inspections but they are completely optional. We know some teams have been working on improving robots over the summer, please feel free to use this event as an opportunity to see how these mods work in real gameplay. You still can’t violate any game rules, but rules compliance is honor-system based. As usual weight restrictions are lax also. This event is more about having fun and introducing new team members and the public to FIRST.

There will be access to a shop with tools – it will be ‘open as needed’ so if you need help with something see pit admin and they will direct you how to get there and get someone to help navigate and find things.

## Multiple Robots

In the event we have fewer than 30 registered teams, teams may bring second robots to the competition to complete the desired 30 team roster.

Second robots will be entered as first-come-first-serve basis upon arrival to the event on Saturday Morning. There is no charge for additional robots provided they are part of a team which has paid the registration fee.

Secondary robots will be assigned 'dummy' team numbers but otherwise compete as if they were unique teams. As such, primary and secondary robot may be competing at the same time on the same or opposite alliances - and therefore need an independent drive team for each robot.

This is an excellent opportunity to 'test drive' multiple drivers or teams on the same day!

## Video and Audio Recording

This event will store and livestream audio, video and still images that may include anyone attending the event. By entering this event you agree to this.
