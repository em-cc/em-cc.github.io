# EMCC's official web-site

EMCC uses [Jekyll Ruby engine](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the content management and Serif as a page layout theme. Every update to this repository automatically updates the web-site by [GitHub's magic](https://pages.github.com/). If you see a misspelled word or have an idea for the website shoot us a merge request or open an issue ticket.

## Deployment

Prerequisites: You need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) to be installed on your system.
Then run `gem install bundler jekyll` in your terminal - this
will install bundler and jekyll gems into your Ruby environment.

To run or edit the web-site locally, clone this repository into a local directory, navigate to that directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
When you start the server it will show a link to open the web-site. Copy and paste it to the address bar of a web-browser.
What you will see is the development copy of the web-site running on your local host. You can start editing the page files
and see how they look like in the browser.

Refer to Jekyll's [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) and other Jekyll's documentation to learn Jekyll.
