# EMCC's official web-site

EMCC uses [Jekyll Ruby engine](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the content management and Serif as a page layout theme. Every update to this repository automatically updates the web-site by [GitHub's magic](https://pages.github.com/). If you see a misspelled word or have an idea for the website shoot us a merge request or open an issue ticket.
