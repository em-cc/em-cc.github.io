Three rules:
1. No score tracking, so no banners for this EMCC.
2. Bring a robot that might work.
3. Drive as much as you want, using whomever wants to drive.
4. (yes, we can’t count to three.) If you happened to install a flamethrower, ax thrower or bowling ball launcher in the off season, let’s leave those at home.
