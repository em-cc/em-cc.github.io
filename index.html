    <p>EMCC will be run as an open house event for 2021.
       <b>Any team with a robot and a couple hours is welcome to stop by and play with other teams in a practice match style event.
          There is no cost for any team to attend.</b>
        If you can attend and have a minute: please send a note to <a href="mailto:emailemcc@gmail.com">emailemcc@gmail.com</a>
        as it will help us plan.
        We will NOT be offering lunch in 2021 - there are local places to grab something quick, or just pack a sandwich alongside
        your drill bits.</p>
