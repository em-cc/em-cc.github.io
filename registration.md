# Volunteering

Volunteers are critical to the success of any tournament. This year the EMCC are asking that all competing teams commit to have two people volunteer at the event. The volunteer slots range in time from 2 hours to 4 hours. Please ask parents of your team members to go to the following signup genius link and sign up for a volunteer slot. We need, approximately, 60 volunteers this is only 2 from each team. Visiting teams do not need to volunteer for Friday night set up or Saturday evening break down.

Thank you
