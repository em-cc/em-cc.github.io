# Payment information:

The registration fee for EMCC 2022 is $250 per team. ([see FAQ about multiple robots]({% link faqs.md %}))
Please send a check as follows:

Payee: East Ridge Robotics Foundation in the amount of $250. **Please write your TEAM NUMBER in the memo line as connecting checks with teams is often difficult.**

Mail check to: 10944 Eagle View Circle, Woodbury, MN 55129. 


# Volunteering:

We may recruit random students and adults to help out with field reset or other tasks. No obligation for you to help, but that wonâ€™t stop us from asking!  If we need help, we will put out an ask to the contact listed in the registration form.

And you can contact our volunteer coordinator here: [emcccoordinator@gmail.com](mailto:emcccoordinator@gmail.com)
