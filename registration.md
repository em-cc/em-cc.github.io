Although very unlikely, **please check back to this page before arriving:** There is a chance **policy could change which cancels the event**, but as of now there are no restrictions, and we are a go!

# Volunteering:

We may recruit random students and adults to help out with field reset or other tasks. No obligation for you to help, but that won’t stop us from asking! There is a signup genius if you can ‘promise’ us some time in advance.
